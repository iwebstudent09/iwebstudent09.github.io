                <p>
                    This week we checked our site's coded HTMl, CSS, and accessibility validation
                    errors. We also had a contest where you submit your UI design or Website
                    into categories like Wonderful Warm Weather, Wonderful Wierd and Wacky,
                    Wow! Wow! Wow!, and Wonderful Working Website. Then we vote to decide the winner.
                    We also made some more custom lettering in Adobe XD. On Thursday, we did a quick
                    review of what we learned this summer.

                        I learned how to code a simple and live website on Github.
                        I created a home page and added some CSS to it. When class was almost done we learned to commit
                        and
                        push the changes we made.
                        Also I used the Terminal app to clone my website to my computer desktop.

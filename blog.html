                    We customized our website prototypes in XD( An app where you can design stuff ) by adding pictures.
                    We
                    also added a link that leads to to the prototype. We made links in the prototype.
                    We added photos from last week to the prototype. At the end of the week, I had a
                    workng prototype in XD.

                    <p>
                        We started to learn how to use Adobe XD, Photoshop, and Illustrator.
                        We also customized font that we drew on a white board or piece of
                        paper. Then we cleaned it up in Illustrator and Xd. We also changed
                        some photos in Photoshop.

                        I deleted all of my CSS frome last week. I started customizing my homepage. I added a pictures
                        and
                        changed my font type. Also I added my sub-pages: About and Blog.
                        My About page gives you the links to the websites I used.
                        The Blog page summarizes what I did in class each week.

                    <h3>Week 1</h3>
                    <div class="date">06/14/2019</div>
                    <p>
                        I learned how to code a simple and live website on Github.
                        I created a home page and added some CSS to it. When class was almost done we learned to commit
                        and
                        push the changes we made.
                        Also I used the Terminal app to clone my website to my computer desktop.
